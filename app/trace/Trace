The addition of the a new product is done by the admin 
when they are logged in. This is done using the 
addProduct.scala.html and using the same controller
method called addProductSubmit(). If the id of the 
product is null then they save the product to 
generate a new id. They find the category for each category
id in catSelect. Then they add each category to
the categories list which is found in the 
newProduct object. Then they update the product
causing a save to the ManyToMany table.
